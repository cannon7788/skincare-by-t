					<p>"625373 out of 10! By far the most relaxing time, I’ve been

					<p>"T was incredible. I have gotten many facials in the past 
					and this one was by far the best I’ve ever received. She 
					started out by asking about my skin and what are my usual 
					skin problems. Then T made sure to pay special attention to 
					those areas. All the products were so gentle on my sensitive 
					skin and smelled amazing. Also while my mask was drying she 
					gave me an arm and foot massage like WOW! Talk about top notch 
					service. I will only be going to T for facials from now on and 
					you should too!" - Destiny</p>

					<p>"My facial was amazing!! So relaxing, the products used on 
					my face smelled incredible and my skin is glowing. T is kind 
					and informative, but totally respected that this mama never 
					gets quiet time at home. I will definitely be coming back!" - Alyssa</p>

						them a moment of peace and comfort in their busy lives. I also want to give you the 
						best value possible for your money. I really love what I do, and I enjoy getting to 
						know my clients. If you have any questions about the services I offer, or how I can 
						tailor them to your needs, please feel free to ask. I am happy to discuss your skincare 
						needs, so go ahead and drop me a line on facebook or instagram! I check them daily. I 
						look forward to hearing from you! -T</p>
