				It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. 
				It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex 
				container the item should take up. If all items have flex-grow 
				set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed 
				equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, 
				the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the
